homework 2


This hw assignment went smoother, and because of the use of 
bootstrap, I was able to make a a more smoothed out version of my previous work, not to mention gave more head space to problem solve some stuff that did't work out with the first go at it. 

In addition to using the solved versions of the class activities as reference points, I pulled a lot from bootstrap, w3schools, javascript.info., and FreeCode Camp.  
 Video tutorials on youtube were flowing far and plenty. IAW tutorial videos helped a lot as far as making buttons do what I wanted them to.

 I got my music player from my bandcamp page; I've probably imbebed a million things in my day, but finally embeded something like this and actually knew what the code I was pasting meant. (yes, thats me playing)
 also,what a great help was the cs-50 lectures from Harvard. 

I added a danger button from bootstrap, but slightly modified it to destroy the whole planet.... video obviously from youtube. 

THe Navigation Bar was nice, and I enjoyed how it turns into a drop down menu when the screen size decreases in size. 

The footer and the css that went along with it was taken from the first homework(revised); I was happy with how it turned out after I worked out all the bugs. 

I opted out at the last minute to use a wallpaper; I felt asthetically it didn't work with my new design and I didn't to add it for the sake gratuity, and I feel like I showed my understanding of containers well enough with what i had already.  

I added the responsive tag to the index image to make it work more with various sizings, but found I didn't need or want to use the same class with the portfolio pics, because there were specific sizing with them and didn't want it to effect that or the spacing.  

On the contact sheet, I changed the submit button to an actual button tag and threw some of that fancy JavaScript action on it we learned about as of recently. 

I definitely utilized the developer tools a lot more and discovered that you can use the arrow keys to raise or decrease the number value to line things up on the editor. After I would line things up, I'd copy the code and drop down on my sheet.
