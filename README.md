homework 2


this hw assignment went a bit smoother, and because of the use of 
bootstrap, I was able to make a a more smoothed out version of my previous work, not to mention gave more head space to problem solve some stuff that did't work out with the first go at it. 

In addition to using the solved versions of the class activities as reference points, I pulled a lot from bootstrap, w3schools, javascript.info. 
 Video tutorials on youtube were flowing far and plenty. IAW tutorial videos helped a lot as far as making buttons do what I wanted them to.

 I got my music player from my bandcamp page; I've probably imbebed a milllion things in my day, but finally embeded something like this and actually knew what the code I was pasting meant. (yes, thats me)
 also great help was the cs-50 lectures from Harvard. 

I added a danger button from bootstrap, but slightly modified it to destroy the whole planet.... video obviously from youtube. 


the footer and the css that went along with it was taken from the first homework(revised); I was happy with how it turned out after I worked out all the bugs.
